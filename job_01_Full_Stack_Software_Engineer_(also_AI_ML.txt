For this role (multiple vacancies):

We are seeking strong software engineers with significant experience (3+, preferably 5+ years) in software engineering, AI/ML, or data engineering for a fast growing, well funded, profitable company in Salt Lake City, Utah (150+ people, Series C stage.) This company has an experienced management team that has had multiple prior successful exits. The product focus is big data analytics on multi-lingual data sets at scale to identify security risks. 

Salary range is $150k to $200k (possibly up to $225k in some cases), depending on the equity mix. Great benefits including a wellness allowance and unlimited PTO. More details will be provided to qualified candidates.

This company is using a typical tech stack (e.g. python/java and running on AWS) though the candidates we seek likely know lots of languages. (We have a separate really cool opportunity in the DC area for people who love things like C/C++, Go/Golang, and Rust -- let us know if that is you.)

With rare exceptions, we are only considering candidates with a computer science degree (undergrad or master's) because, in our experience, this background is needed for success in the technical interviews.

We ARE looking for ANY/ALL of:
-- Prior experience delivering products
-- Experience drawing conclusions from large scale, messy data sets
-- Experience working with multi-lingual data
-- Experience with security analytics
-- Experience working/scaling a strong team

We are NOT looking for:
-- PowerBI/dashboards (wrong kind of data science)
-- .NET or C#
-- Mobile apps/iOS/Android
-- Recent college graduates (it's a brutal market for recent graduates, unfortunately)
-- Non-US citizens (while a clearance is not required, candidates must be potentially clearable)
