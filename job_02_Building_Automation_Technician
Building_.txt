JOB TITLE: Building Automation Technician
Building Automation Technician
American Mechanica
About the job
Are you a natural tinkerer who was always taking things apart as a kid just to see how they worked, and now are just as comfortable with a laptop and system interface as with a screwdriver and a wrench? Do you believe that excellence is in the details and take pride in maintaining clear, uniform standards that any other tech can step into and understand? And do you want your work to mean something and to be part of a place where the people and the systems run better because of how you show up?

If so, you might be a great fit with us as a Building Automation Technician, spending your days using both your mechanical know-how and BAS programming/commissioning skills
to bring HVAC systems, sensors, and software to life while making buildings run smarter.

We believe the best results come from the same people owning the whole picture, from HVAC equipment to BAS programming and commissioning, just as the mechanical equipment and the controls logic work together. When you understand and work on what’s happening in both the system and the space, you can solve root causes instead of symptoms and make buildings perform better for everyone inside.

We specialize in high-quality HVAC service, retrofits, and controls projects, including the renovation and modernization of older, occupied buildings. American Mechanical Services of Denver is part of a privately owned family of companies with operations in Colorado, Texas, California, Maryland, Virginia, and beyond.

What You Can Expect from Us:

A people-first, family-first culture and predictable hours. You're in charge of your schedule with a standard 40-hour week. While there may at times be a 50-hour week once a month (scheduled several weeks in advance when possible), you won't be on call. We genuinely prioritize taking care of our team and have demonstrated that through many of our valued team members’ biggest personal challenges. During COVID, no one lost even an hour of pay. With a median tenure approaching ten years and employee retention far above industry average, we’ve built stability on mutual respect.

Stability with purpose. In business for over thirty years and growing at a steady, sustainable pace, we are large enough to offer opportunity but personal enough that you’ll never feel lost in the crowd. Many of our customers have stayed with us for decades because we build deep, long-lasting trust by combining an unwavering commitment to integrity with transparent, meticulous workmanship that always prioritizes the right solution based on their needs.

Leaders who’ve been in your boots. Your manager was a Controls Technician here before growing into a management role, and the Senior Leadership, Management, and Sales Teams started in the field. They understand the work, respect the craft, and still pick up tools when needed. You’ll never be asked to do something they haven’t done or wouldn’t do themselves.

Autonomy with real support. Once you learn our culture and standards, you’ll own your projects from start to finish—setting schedules and priorities while knowing experienced technical leaders are there whenever you need backup.

Investment in your growth. You’ll keep sharpening your craft with paid training, certifications, and mentorship while also developing the human side of the work—communication, judgment, and self-awareness—where management learns and participates alongside technicians. You’ll have space to expand your skills and, as you grow and as opportunities arise, advancement is based on merit and skill (technical expertise, project success, and people skills).

Fairness, follow-through, and strong benefits. If something isn’t right, it gets fixed. We listen to our techs, act on feedback, and back it all with full family healthcare, a union pension, paid training, safety recognition, 12 union-covered sick days, PTO built into weekly pay at $3/hr (~4 weeks annually), a stocked company service vehicle, phone, uniforms, and tools.

What You’ll Be Doing:

Own the whole process. You’ll take projects from device install through programming, commissioning, and service—working on both the mechanical and controls sides. From chillers and boilers to sensors, Niagara/Tridium, and BACnet systems, you’ll make complex systems run as one by creating and modifying sequences of operation, mapping points, configuring graphics, trends, and alarms, and performing functional testing.

Think like a system, not a symptom. You’ll diagnose root causes instead of patching surface issues—using critical thinking, logic, and curiosity to understand how every component interacts, whether you built the system or are servicing one you didn’t install.

Keep craftsmanship visible. Apply and uphold our clean, consistent standards so any technician can walk in, read your work, and immediately know what’s happening. That’s pride of workmanship.

Communicate and collaborate. You’ll interact directly with customers, teammates, and leadership—sharing data, explaining your reasoning, documenting, and keeping everyone aligned. Clear communication is valued as highly as technical skill.

Mentor, learn, and expand your range. You’ll help apprentices and peers grow while continuing to refine your own craft, building technical range and people skills through diverse projects, training, and mentorship.

Other duties as assigned.

Requirements:

U.S. work authorization required.
Able to work within the Denver metro area, with some work in Colorado Springs and Gypsum.
Equivalent of 5-10+ years full-time commercial HVAC work (installing, maintaining, troubleshooting, or repairing equipment).
Equivalent of three years full-time in building automation controls programming, commissioning, or service at the database/sequence level (not just device installation or setpoint changes). Niagara/Tridium experience preferred. Certification is a plus.
Comfort with BACnet/IP and MS/TP setup and basic network troubleshooting experience is preferred but not required.
OSHA 10/30 preferred; commitment to AMS’s long-standing safety culture required.
Valid driver’s license and clean driving record.
Strong troubleshooting skills across mechanical, electrical, and BAS controls, including root-cause diagnosis and commissioning.

Compensation and Benefits:

Compensation for this role is approximately $100,000 annually. The position pays $48 per hour, a rate that includes a $3/hr weekly vacation payout in lieu of a traditional PTO accrual system (vacation time is pre-paid and self-managed). In addition to this wage, the role includes 12 union-covered sick days, a full Pipefitters Local 208 union benefits package featuring employer-funded family healthcare and pension. Other benefits include a stocked company vehicle, a company phone, uniforms, and paid drive time for extended travel beyond one hour from Denver. Clear advancement paths exist for those who earn them—whether through programming expertise, commissioning specialization, or leadership within the field.
