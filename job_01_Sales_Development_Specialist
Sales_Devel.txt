About the job
Job Title: Enterprise Sales Development Representative (SDR) 
 Location: Denver, CO, Onsite (In Office) 
 The Opportunity: Join the ground floor of fifthelement.ai, an enterprise AI company building AI agents that work, not just chat. While the world is hyped on generic LLMs, we are deploying trusted, secure, and hallucination-free AI agents for global leaders like Revolut, Atlas Copco, and SaskTel.
This isn’t a standard SDR role. You aren’t just selling SaaS... you are selling the future of work (AI Agents) to C-Level executives and VP's who are desperate for solutions that actually deliver ROI.
 About You: You are a hunter. You don’t wait for leads; you create them. You are intellectually curious, competitive, and want to build a career in the most important technology shift of our generation. You understand that "No" just means "Not yet," and you know how to cut through the noise to get a decision-maker's attention.
 What You’ll Do:
Hunt High-Value Accounts: Identify and qualify enterprise opportunities through strategic outbound prospecting (Phone, Email, LinkedIn, and Video).
Master the "Why Fifth" Story: articulately pitch complex value props: ROI, Trust, Governance, and Agentic Workflows, to technical and business leaders.
Run a Tight Ship: Manage your pipeline in HubSpot with precision.
Use AI to Sell AI: Leverage our own platform and modern stack (LinkedIn Sales Nav, ZoomInfo) to research prospects and personalize outreach at scale.
Partner with Leadership: Work directly with AEs and Leadership to refine the GTM playbook. Your feedback from the front lines matters.
 The Metrics (How You Win):
Activity: Maintain high-velocity daily outreach volume. We value grit and hustle.
Quota: 12 Qualified Meetings per quarter.
Super Quota: 20 Qualified Meetings per quarter.
 Qualifications:
Education: Bachelor’s degree required (Preferred 3.5+ GPA).
Experience: 0–3 years in sales, business development, or a high-performance customer-facing role.
Grit: Proven history of competitiveness (sports, academic achievements, or overcoming adversity).
Communication: Elite verbal and written skills. 
Tech Savvy: Familiarity with CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot) and prospecting tools is a plus.
 Why Join Us?
Sell Reality, not Hype: We have live, enterprise customers. Our tech works.
Fast Track your pay and career: We raise your base each time you meet quota. We promote from within. Crush your numbers here to get promoted into Account Executive less than a year.
Benefits:  Health, Dental, 401K no waiting period
The Team: Work with a leadership team that has built successful software companies before.
